  ## Description

Starting from scratch, this website utilized: MySQL, ORM, Handlebars, Javascript, CSS, node.js and several npm packages to capture the finished product. The objective was to use MySQL to create a database for burgers the user wants to eat, and allows them to 'devour' it whenever they want. 

Once the user chooses to devour the burger, it will render on the right side of the screen, along with all the other devoured burgers. Object Relational Mapping was required to orchestrate the functionality between Handlebars, MySQL and Javascript.
